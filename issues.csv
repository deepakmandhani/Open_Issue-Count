1828,Builds timeout after success,RealNobody, , ,OPEN,This is not something that happens every time, but it has been happening a reasonable amount recently.

Sometimes when we run a build, it times out.  I have not identified any reliable circumstances under which this happens.

When I look at the timed out builds, I cannot see anything in the console output that indicates why it timed out.  In the console output, I see the same basic output as I do for a successful run except that the last step that is shown is `uploading artifacts` and the `save_reports` step is the only missing step.

If we do get a timeout, running it again often gets a green build.

The test suite on average runs for about 30 minutes, well within the 2 hour or so timeout.

The only diagnostic information I may have is the following:

The time for a script does not seem to be based on how long a test actively runs.  The time starts as of the moment that the test build button is clicked rather than as of the time that the test actually starts doing active work.  I have seen at least one timeout where a test started and couldn't get a worker for the timeout period so it never even pulled the code from git or anything, it just timedout waiting.

I don't know in any of the timeout failures we have if this is a factor or not.  It could be in that if the timeout is 2 hours and the run sits for 1.9 hours before starting to pull and run, the timeout could be a false negative because the total run time was too long.

It seems weird to me though that in 5 or 6 timeouts that I can remember looking at they all failed at the same point - right after uploading artifacts.

From my perspective, it seems like one of the following may be happening:

* The timeout is occurring because shippable is doing some post processing work that is getting into some kind of infinite loop and timing out.
* The timeout is only checked at certain points which would allow the script to start running, run and then fail at the first checkpoint.

It would be nice if the timeout time was based on the run time after it gets a worker rather than from the time that the build is started.  That would make more sense to me.,

1821,[Security] Builds and details still accessible when user is excluded from Bitbucket organization,bittner, , ,OPEN,When you're part of an organization and you create a Shippable account by logging in using e.g. Bitbucket you can see all public and private repositories.

1819,Can't trigger new builds,nigelwinterburn, , ,OPEN,I can't trigger a new build.

1818,Feature request: make it easier to identify skipped tests in test report,ixdy, , ,OPEN,I created a PR to use Shippable's test report parsing functionality in kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/13114.

A test report from an example run such as (https://app.shippable.com/builds/55de3d96f44cfb0c00153ccf) shows 1886 Passing and 9 Skipped tests, but there is no easy way to identify which tests were skipped.

Additionally, the GitHub commit status shows "Shippable builds completed. 3772/3790 tests passed", not making it clear that there were skipped tests. (Instead, one might wonder why some tests didn't pass, wondering if there were actually failures.),
1817,Code coverage report not useful with Go projects,ixdy, , ,OPEN,I tried adding Shippable code coverage support to the Kubernetes unit tests in kubernetes/kubernetes#13171. Shippable parses the coverage XML file without issue, but it reports 0% branch and sequence coverage across the entire project (e.g. https://app.shippable.com/builds/55de3e23f44cfb0c0015a260).

I'm guessing this is because the Go coverage tools seem to only report statement coverage. As it stands, this means that the coverage utility in Shippable isn't really useful for us, however.,
1813,Artifacts are not being uploaded sometimes,RealNobody, , ,OPEN,When a build succeeds or if ONLY RSpec fails, then artifacts are uploaded.

However, (so far) whenever the Cucumber tests fail, artifacts are not uploaded.

Here is a sample Cucumber failure:  https://app.shippable.com/builds/55d78ac1831cd10b00df2f5b
An RSpec failure (with artifacts): https://app.shippable.com/builds/55d7640032a7bd0c00a467a9
And a success: https://app.shippable.com/builds/55d7a2fd1f61b10c00280272

I can't find anything in the console output that tells me why the artifacts aren't being uploaded.  All I see is:

```
script
  <output of running the script>

uploading artifacts to s3
  echo 'skipping upload'
```

What is interesting is that I do NOT see the after script:
```
script:
 - rspec -r yarjuf -f JUnit -o shippable/testresults/results.xml
 - cd dashboard && node_modules/.bin/ember test ci --silent -c testem-ci.json > ../shippable/testresults/emberresults.xml && cd ..
 - DISPLAY=localhost:1.0 xvfb-run bundle exec cucumber --tags ~@skip-ci --format junit --out shippable/testresults

after_script:
 - cp -r cornucopia_report shippable/testresults
```

What I am wondering is why does the after_script not run if Cucumber fails.  I really need the artifacts because they contain diagnostic information to tell me why Cucumber is failing.

Thanks,
1808,Including global environment variables in matrix,ixdy, , ,OPEN,I'm trying to include a number of environment variables across all variations of our matrix. In particular, the configuration I'm trying is [here](https://github.com/ixdy/kubernetes/blob/coveralls/shippable.yml).

However, based on the [Shippable build results](https://app.shippable.com/builds/55d5188f4e6e0d0c001d6dba), it seems like these variables aren't being exported.

1756,Google App Engine deployments aren't sustainable long-term,aaronwest, , ,OPEN,Google App Engine deployments, using the appcfg.py Python toolkit, do not work long-term. I'm using GAE SDK v1.9.24 and following the Shippable documentation listed [here](http://docs.shippable.com/appengine/#deployment-of-a-python-application) and am not able to get GAE deployments to work long-term.

I am able to get deployments to work, under certain conditions, for an hour until the GAE tokens expire. More on this below.

The Shippable documentation linked above outlines two scenarios for GAE deployments: password authentication or OAuth2 authentication. I've tried both and have been partially successful with OAuth2 authentication.

#### Password authentication

The Shippable docs instruct users to global env vars, one for your Google email and one for your Google password. With of course the password being encrypted using the project settings on Shippable. Then, the docs say to use the following command:

>- echo "$GAE_PASSWORD" | $GAE_DIR/google_appengine/appcfg.py -e "$EMAIL" --passin update .

The `--passin` flag is not available in the GAE SDK v1.9.24. I'm not sure when it was removed but it isn't available in the latest version of the SDK and there doesn't appear to be a replacement. Nevertheless, I attempted to get password-based authentication working by searching and seeing how others were doing it. I also consulted the Google docs. I was never able to get it working.

#### OAuth2 authentication

After failing with password-based authentication I tried OAuth2. I followed the Shippable instructions [here](http://docs.shippable.com/appengine/#deployment-of-a-python-application) which ask users to call a method of appcfg.py (`list_versions`) which lists application versions (Google supports up to 10 versions) for the app you have deployed on GAE. A byproduct of the calling this command - or any other command - of appcfg.py is the storage of an app token in the user's home directory. The token is called `.appcfg_oauth2_tokens` and is a basic JSON file which includes several pieces of information. Notable data are the app token string and the token expiry. The token expiry is a date in UTC (more specifically it is stored as zulu time in JSON) and is set to +1 hours from the time the `.appcfg_oauth2_tokens` was written to disk.

NOTE: The token is only written to disk if the user accepts the OAuth2 session in the browser.

The Shippable instructions go on to ask the user to encrypt the access token using a Shippable secure variable. No specific instructions are given which is unfortunate. But, the basic workflow is for the user to copy only the string in the `access_token` portion of the `.appcfg_oauth2_tokens` file. Then, copy that value, plus a corresponding name you make up, into *Encrypt Env Vars* in your Shippable project settings. This will then give you a value you can define as a secret in your shippable.yml file and use as a `$variable` in the appcfg.py command.

Once I figured all of this out I pushed a feature branch to GitHub and Shippable walked through the build process. And it worked. I was super happy.

An little while later I executed the same process and the Shippable build failed with error message:

>google.appengine.tools.appengine_rpc_httplib2.AuthPermanentFail: Access token is invalid.

So I spent a few hours searching, reading GAE documentation, and trying to get builds to work. I discovered the invalid token was due to GAE expiring ALL OAuth2 tokens after 1 hour. On a local machine such as my Mac this isn't a problem. The `.appcfg_oauth2_tokens` file exists on my machine and when I execute appcfg.py GAE simply updates the `access_token` value and the `token_expiry`. When executing the same command in a Shippable build it fails. This is because the `.appcfg_oauth2_tokens` file doesn't exist in the container AND the token being used as the secret (encrypted env var) is now invalid.

After more searching I tried the `--oauth2_refresh_token` switch in appcfg.py instead of the `--oauth2_access_token` switch in the Shippable documentation. As long as the token I was using as the secret env var was not expired, this command worked.

In summary, there doesn't appear to be a way to get long-term Shippable builds working with GAE. I couldn't get password authentication working and even if I could I don't want the deployment process tied to my Google Apps email. Also, the OAuth2 based authentication, while it can be engineered to work, doesn't work beyond 1 hour.

Here's some documentation pages I read while I was trying to get all this working. Hopefully, someone else can make sense of this process and we can get things working. In the meantime, my team will build and deploy to GAE using appcfg.py locally instead of through Shippable webhooks to GitHub. That's unfortunate but we need a predictable/working solution.

1718,Running parallel processes hangs a build,rudism, , ,OPEN,The latest build I have seen this in: https://app.shippable.com/builds/55b2b63e432f1f0c00fd0b32

In my build I'm trying to call a shell script that runs several test suites in parallel. I've used a few different methods, including spawning the processes with `&` and using the `wait` command, using GNU Parallel, and using `xargs -P`. In every case, after the command finishes, the build hangs and eventually times out. For example, calling a script that looks something like any of these seems to hang the build:

    #!/bin/sh
    testrunner --class class1 &
    testrunner --class class2 &
    wait
or

    #!/bin/sh
    parallel testrunner --class {} ::: class1 class2
or

    #!/bin/sh
    echo class1 class2 | xargs -n1 -P2 testrunner --class

I see the output from each of the commands in every case up to the completion of the final process, but then all output stops and the build does not seem to progress any farther.

The strange thing is that I have a notifier that runs in the `after_success` and `after_failure` blocks, and the jobs that hang will notify me that they have succeeded (meaning the `after_success` block is being run, even though the job is still listed as processing and eventually times out).,

1712,Can't have node_js 0.12 alongside xvfb without waiting 10+ minutes per build?,posita, , ,OPEN,Originally, our `shippable.yml` file was this:

```yml
language: node_js

node_js:
  - "0.12"

addons:
  firefox: "29.0"

services:

before_script:
  - "git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/laurentj/slimerjs.git"
  - "export SLIMERJS_BIN=`pwd`/slimerjs/src/slimerjs"
  - "export SLIMERJSLAUNCHER=firefox-bin"
  - "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
  - "/etc/init.d/xvfb start"
```

But that took 10+ minutes to set up before even getting to the tests. So we added:

```yml
cache: true
```

But that didn't seem to do anything, plus it's [going away](http://blog.shippable.com/shippable-3.0-breaking-changes#BuildImage). So we added:

```yml
build_image: shippableimages/ubuntu1204_nodejs
```
Which sped up the time it took to get to the `before_script` step quite a bit, but then we failed on `/etc/inid./xvfb start`:

```
/root/[...].sh: line 87: /etc/init.d/xvfb: No such file or directory
```

Waiting 10+ minutes for a build is unusable for us. How do we use node_js 0.12 alongside xvfb?,
1709,CPU leak during archiving step,xherriot, , ,OPEN,Hello,

During the build, the console works fine but when arrived to the archiving step, my CPU goes to 100% (and ram x2), (Firefox does not respond) until the end of the step.

1708,Pushing to GCR causes 403 "Access Denied",donmasakayan, , ,OPEN,In the final step of the build process when we're about to push the container to GCR, I'm getting either this error ([Build] (https://app.shippable.com/builds/55af5ca285656f0b006cf3ca)):
```
Sending image list
Error: Status 403 trying to push repository friendly-neighbors/api: "Access denied."
```

OR this error ([Build] (https://app.shippable.com/builds/55af64ec85656f0b007cbece)):
```
Sending image list
Please login prior to push:
Username: EOF
```


In GCR's documentation, [they do mention something about this here](https://cloud.google.com/tools/container-registry/?hl=en_US&_ga=1.128611918.357180263.1429696607#access_denied). Something about docker 1.7.x breaking the way docker writes credentials.

Other than that, I've set up GCR integration correctly.

Please advise. Thanks.,

1698,MultiOS Tests,AbdealiJK, , ,OPEN,HI,

I was trying to setup tests for windows, OSX and Linux on shippable - and I wasn't able to find any yaml configuration for making a build matrix with all three.

Is multi OS tests possible ?

Is there any example yml file to test all 3 OSes with python I could refer to ?,
1697,Long-running mono process segfaults,rudism, , ,OPEN,I am having an issue with a shippable build that installs mono, compiles a project, and then runs some integration tests.

Here is an example of a failed build:
https://app.shippable.com/builds/55ad582a696c7f0b00588662

The step that fails is using mono to run the xunit console runner against our integration tests DLL. The integration tests are probably the most resource intensive step of our build--it downloads and restores a postgresql database from S3, then spins up local copies of our application (which get linked to a copy of the restored database, and tested by making local web requests against). We have a number of different test suites that run which each get their own copy of the database (to prevent each suite from affecting the data that the others have access to). This takes quite a long time to complete, and has successfully completed in some builds, but more often than not I get a segmentation fault in the mono executable.

When I load up ubuntu1404_base into a local docker container on my machine and run all of the commands from my shippable yml file locally, everything works fine every time (no seg faults), which leads me to believe there is some difference or perhaps some limitation being imposed on the process when Shippable runs it, but I am at a loss with trying to figure out how to debug or track this problem down.

Any help, suggestions, or guidance would be appreciated.

1695,GO Versions,Nalum, , ,OPEN,I'm trying to run tests on a go project and have added the following versions:
```
language: go

go:
  - 1.4
  - release 
  - tip
```

The problem I'm encountering is the following for both `release` and `tip`:

![shippable-error-01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/384180/8773753/99119d10-2ece-11e5-814e-9fd0c2d82a5b.png)
,
1692,Extract file from container; publish as binary asset to GitHub release,garthk, , ,OPEN,I need to run a task in a Docker container and extract the result, e.g.:

```
set -x
docker build -t $TAG .
CID=`docker run -d $TAG`
docker logs -f $CID
docker cp $CID:$OUTPUTFILE .
```

How do I do this with a pre- or post-CI Docker build? The documentation doesn't make it clear whether Shippable can conclude a build by extracting build artifacts and [post it to a GitHub release](https://github.com/quantum/shippable-utils/blob/master/github-release.sh).,
1691,Automatically bring up new EC2 instance before running tests?,calebwherry, , ,OPEN,Instead of paying Amazon to keep an EC2 instance running 24/7, is there a way to have shippable spin one up automatically when tests are triggered?

I want to be able to know if some developer pushed code without proper test coverage.,
1681,Shippable won't build Centos 7 containers,buley, , ,OPEN,I've found the following at the top of a `Dockerfile` will cause my builds to fail on Shippable:

	FROM    centos:latest
	RUN yum -y install epel-release \
	  && yum -y update \
	  && yum -y upgrade
    ...

I've tried a number of different pulled images to build from, but it seems related to (apparently) some usage of AUFS somewhere.  https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/6980 Using the currently-supported `centos6.6` was my fix.

e.g. https://app.shippable.com/builds/55a72e96b617690b00155cd9

1665,/subscriptions/... page consistently takes more than 10 seconds to load,pquentin, , ,OPEN,Shippable has always been slow since we started using it in December 2014. We had hoped speed would have become a priority, but it does not look like it. Our network is not fast, but Shippable still is the exception. The slowest page on shippable for us it the subscriptions page, that list the status of our 39 shippable projects.

 * On load, Firefox reports 151 requests and 2MB page size, for a page load time between 10.71s and 11.24s for a sample size of 5 pages loads.
 * On reload, Firefox reports 159 requests and 2.5MB page size, for a page load time between 12.10s and 13.30s.

The page load seems to be divided in three main parts:

 1. Calls to app.shippable.com. They're *fast*, between 50ms and 500ms and well distributed, so they end after 1.5s at most.
 2. 30 requests to api.shippable.com. They're also fast, but seem to happen sequentially. They end after 8s.
 3. Many calls to api.shippable.com/projects/.../searchBuilds?status=complete&limit=1&isPR=false. They seem to be distributed, but seem to hit what looks like a concurrent requests Firefox limit. They spend more and more time waiting, and the last requests take 3s.

I'd be happy to share anything else that could help debug the issue. I'll send the organization name by email, but continuing the discussion here would be nice. Thank you for shippable!,

1651,Non-deterministic error messages in tests,hcarver, , ,OPEN,I'm getting random error messages in my tests about end-of-files and broken pipes.

They often seem to start with integration tests that use Capybara, though they also seem to then affect database access from functional tests that don't use Capybara.

They almost always take the form of
`EOFError: end of file reached` or
`Errno::EPIPE: Broken pipe`.

It's very annoying. It's happening in about 25% of our builds, and means we have to manually re-run builds a lot of the time, which is a pain for our whole CD process.,

In my yml-file, I set language: java and jdk: oraclejdk8.

I think the issue is that a JDK < Java 1.8u40 is used for this build. If so, using a newer version probably solves this issue. Local build with 1.8u45 is fine. How can I set this version in the yml file?

I have this part:

```
script:
  - cd test
  - errgergerherhhr
```

It produces an error `/home/shippable/cab1dd50-c254-4655-99c5-3ef22e6408d5.sh: line 90: errgergerherhhr: command not found`

The `after_script` is never run.

Is this an expected behaviour?

---------

Ok, I have run a small test on this. It is because I change the working directory to somewhere else. I'm not sure why though.

--------

I've found a workaround:

```
script:
  - (cd test/ && exec some_program_that_errors)
```

In this way, the `after_script` is run properly.

The other combination won't run `after_script`, for example, `(cd test/ && some_program_that_errors)`.

Please let me know if you cannot reproduce it.,
1608,Dynamically change/cancel docker image to build ,xherriot, , ,OPEN,Hello,

I would like to do:
• Commit with tag *-alpha, build my/app:alpha
• Commit with tag *-beta, build my/app:beta
• Commit with tag *, build my/app:latest
• Commit without tag, CI without build a docker image.

To this, I have a bash script executed "after script":
```yml
after_script:
  - 'bash shippable-deploy.sh'
```

Content of this file:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

hash=$(git log -n 1 --pretty=format:"%H")
tag=$(git tag --points-at $hash)

if [[ -n "$tag" ]]
then
    echo "Tag: $tag"
    dir=./shippable/buildoutput/"$tag"/
    echo "Dir: $dir"
    mkdir "$dir"
    cp -R ./dist/* "$dir"
    ln -s "$dir"/../.common/ "$dir"/.common/
    echo "$tag" > ./shippable/buildoutput/"$tag"/version.txt
else
    echo "No tag related, we don't add this to the Docker image."
    echo "Hack for CI without docker build." > ./shippable/buildoutput/shippable.txt
fi
```

Then, the build is processed with my Dockerfile:
```docker
FROM my/app
ADD ./buildoutput/ /var/www/app/
```

Each build tagged add its own directory (named with the tag) to the docker image.
For now, for a commit without tag, I have to do a trick to build the Docker image without send my real build (if no file is added, shippable fail).
And for now, all my builds tagged are send to my/app:latest image (then, its a big image).
(For some reasons, I have to keep each tagged build a certain time)

It would be nice if inside the shippable.yml file, we could do something like that:
```yml
tags:
    *-alpha*:
        docker:
            build: Dockerfile.alpha
            to: my/app:alpha
    *-beta*:
        docker:
            build: Dockerfile.beta
            to: my/app:beta
    *:
        docker:
            build: Dockerfile
            to: my/app:latest
    none:
        docker: 
            build: false
```
Then check if the commit we test is related to a tag.

(Launch a CI when a new tag is send to the repository (without any commit) would be nice too) ,
1601,Guage resource usage on shippable,bprashanth, , ,OPEN,There are times when I've observed what looks like high n/w latencies in my test logs (but could also be eg: cpu starvation of a goroutine pulling stuff off of the network). We run tests in parallel and sometimes things might get loaded. How does one figure out where the resource boundry is? 

I don't mean how many cores I'm supposed to get, I mean how much cpu etc my tests are *actually* using. If i was on a linux box I would use top/ps/sar etc to profile it. I suppose the promise of virtualization is that this should not be necessary, but do you export any time-series machine stats? 

I only want a way to increase the confidence that a flake that the logs say is because of high latency, correlates with spikes of machine stats. I've not had much luck reproducing these spikes locally on n1-standard-1 gce machines.,

1587,enable code coverage for golang,rvdwijngaard, , ,OPEN,I have a build configured for go. My configuration is pretty much the same as the sample in your docs. After completing a build successfully, however, there is no code coverage. I added some logging statements to my shippable.yml and at the after-script hook there is a file named ./shippable/codecoverage/coverage.xml.

1557,Shippable does not display phpunit test results...,pennyarcade, , ,OPEN,Hello Team,

I followed the documentation very closely to set up phpunit tests (among others) with shippable using the '--log-junit' option and the '--coverage.xml' option. 
I am using the standard image for now.
My coverage results are displayed correctly and the phpunit output looks ok, too. (Failing as expected)
Sadly I can't seem to get the phpunit results displayed in the testresults tab. I tried different filenames and triplechecked output directory and format. Please help.

Also my composer update fails when I turn caching on. It gets a permission denied on the cache directory. File permissions are OK, there might be an Issue of files already being open that I can't reproduce locally. I am trying to test a small Symfony application. The intendet result should be saving build time by caching but keeping dependencies up to date.
Update: This only happens for the buildin global composer. I have no errors when using my own composer.phar in the project directory.

Third and least important, I'd like to also display my code sniffer results of PHPMD and PHPCS in the testresults tab. The output is set to xml, too.

1550,build timeouts,magwas, , ,OPEN,I have a build which consists of some python unit tests followed with some selenium tests in python for chrome and firefox. For the selenium tests I run an apache on ports 8888 and 8889, and a fake smtp server on 1025, all on 127.0.0.1. The build runs nicely on travis.

However there are a lot of cases when it just times out.

1535,~50% Build Failures,jchamberlain, , ,OPEN,Hello,

I'm using a dedicated host, and in the last week or so I've been having at least half of builds fail for seemingly random reasons, including:
- Failing to connect to the Docker registry ("tcp: lookup registry-1.docker.io on 69.20.0.164:53: no such host")
- Doing nothing at all. All it ever shows is the "save reports" step. This is probably the most common error.
- Timing out with no message.

Has anything changed?

Update: I just deployed a fresh server for shippable, and nothing's changed.,

1530,Shippable hangs with no response when running velocity tests with Meteor.js,imarichardson, , ,OPEN,I am trying to run shippable against my meteor.js app.
My tests are in cucumber running via meteor's testing architecture, velocity. One of the things core to testing in meteor is that the app will need to run a cloned instance of itself so the tests can actually run. When I run the test my app perpetually runs; I've decided to not stop the latest build to see how long it will run and at this point it appears to be around 35 minutes. The build continues to show processing with no feedback.

1529,Branch name with semantic versioning skipped,andrerom, , ,OPEN,Hi,

we have a branch name called "5.4" and shippable keeps on skipping it, even if we added a shippable.yml in master to say this branch should be tests. older branches in format like "stable-5.3" does not have this issue.

i.e.:
```
Webhook Received for a Branch Excluded by YML in ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel-ee  Today at 11:32 PM Low

Webhook received for branch 5.4, which is not included in branches: only tag in YML.

1523,Any known issues with mocha-junit-reporter over-reporting number of passed tests?,tinisi, , ,OPEN,Folks,
Loving your service, getting very close to a useful CI solution.

We have a node app with about 1100 server side mocha tests.

Ever since we have switched to using mocha-junit-reporter with your service, the total number of tests shown in your web report is much inflated, by about a factor of 20.

When I run the tests locally with tap reporter, I see what I would expect.

We have tried a number of different set ups, letting mocha discover all our tests in a folder, and using a shell script and the mocha --grep option to run portions of the tests, but the number of passed tests is always high.

The failures seem to be reported correctly.

Are there any known issues that might cause this?

Thanks!

1520,Git sync clones into wrong directory when pulling from bitbucket repo,vially, , ,OPEN,The `git_sync` step clones the repo into: `~/workspace/src/bitbucket.com` instead of `~/workspace/src/bitbucket.org`

This is causing issues with the Go language because the import paths have to match the file locations on disk.

I know you can fix it by defining the `SHIPPABLE_REPO_DIR` global env var but I think that should be the default behaviour so I don't have to clutter the `shippable.yml` file for every Go project
```yaml
env:
  global:
    - SHIPPABLE_REPO_DIR="$HOME/workspace/src/bitbucket.org/$REPO_NAME"
```

1505,Cannot connect to port on dedicated host & custom image,RobertHerhold, , ,OPEN,I bought dedicated host support and created and pushed a public docker image based off of this repo: https://github.com/shippableImages/mongoBase.

I am able to run the container and connect to it just fine on my local machine (port 27017). Is there something special I need to do either on my dedicated host or in my custom image to resolve this issue?

Running `mongo` (Mongo shell) returns 
```
connecting to: test
couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017...

I have tried this with a separate database, different port, and different docker images but have never been able to connect.

With this being an issue, dedicated hosts are absolutely useless. Please advise.,
1504,How do I bind a docker build to a database addon?,tal-moshayov, , ,OPEN,I'm using a custom docker image for my build, which requires a db (postgres) to run its tests. So I added:
`addons:  
  postgresql : "9.3"
` to shippable.yml.
Now, assuming shippable kickstarts the database addon in the background, **what is the db host name and port I should bind to?**  
It appears that on a shippable predefined image the addon is automatically bound to localhost, but it doesn't seem to be this way with a custom docker image.,

1497,Docker cleanup affects non-shippable containers,rogierslag, , ,OPEN,We run our build server now just on one of the other docker hosts (thats what docker is for right!) but it appears then the "cleaning" of old containers also will try to remove any container. So also containers which should not be cleaned by shippable (such as other regular development stuff).

Can it please be possible to disable this? Using docker we do no longer need static ci servers. Please don't replace those static CI servers with static docker servers!,
1490,Build Dockerfile and push to Quay.io,howarddierking, , ,OPEN,Hey all - sorry if this question is a repeat, but in reading through the other threads, I'm having a hard time teasing apart the requests for custom _build_ containers vs. support for building container images from my project artifacts. It is the latter scenario that I'm interested in.

I need to support the following workflow:

* Build the project (e.g. current workflow)
* Build an image from the Dockerfile (need to also be able to tag it with the build number)
* Login to Quay.io (robot account)
* Push image to Quay.io

Maybe down the road I'll bake in automated deployment, but because we do deployments at the entire auto-scaling group level and need to support multi-container orchestration, I'll probably continue to do this out of band for some time.

So, is this workflow supported in Shippable today?,

I have a project hosted on GitHub with several submodules. For the shippable build, I do not want these submodules to be fetched, so I included a

```
git:
   submodules: false

clause into ```shippable.yml```. However, that does not seem to have any effect. I continue to see the following build steps:

```
 ssh-agent bash -c 'ssh-add /root/.ssh/project_rsa; git clone git@github.com:sbalko/libav.js.git /root/workspace/src/github.com/sbalko/libav.js'

 git reset --hard f78c31dbe932080e7811bcb780e4dc73287bd87a

Why are the latter two steps happening? Isn't that what is supposed to be suppressed by the "submodules: false" clause?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

1434,Build number format for docker images,rvdwijngaard, , ,OPEN,Hi, 

According to your blog article http://blog.shippable.com/immutable-containers-with-version-tags-on-docker-hub all pushed docker images are provided with a tag which contains the build number. 

My images are tagged with the branchname + build number (without the revision number).

In my yaml I want to update some metadata file in s3 with the docker image version: 
- sed -e "s;%BUILD_NUMBER%;$BUILD_NUMBER;g" ecs/machinelogservice.json > ecs/tmp.json

The build number contains the build number + revision (in my case 60.1).

1420,Handling multiple projects in a single repository,marcua, , ,OPEN,It looks like `shippable.yml` must be in the root of the git repo.  Say I have one large repository with multiple codebases (e.g., two django projects, or some python code and some js code), and for concreteness let's say they are in `gitrepo:/python_project1` and `gitrepo:/python_project2`.  The questions that arise for me are:

  - How do I get tests in both directories to run---can I have multiple `script` and `install` tags for each project?
  - Will the coverage and test reports for each project be reported separately?

If you have an example `shippable.yml` that handles this case, I'd be very grateful!

1405,Automated deployment to Digital Ocean,naveensky, , ,OPEN,Hi,

I am looking forward to setup automated deployment to Docker instances on Digital Ocean. Do you have a tutorial/setup guide in regards to the same.

I need to deploy a Java app

Naveen,
1404,gulp: ../deps/uv/src/unix/core.c:422: uv__close: Assertion `fd > 2' failed.,andrewmichaelsmith, , ,OPEN,A gulp task to SCP some files after a successful load now consistently fails.

For the past 4 months this task has worked perfectly for over 80 builds. Now the past 3 builds have all failed. I have changed nothing on the host machine and the tasks succeeds from other servers.

The task:

```
gulp.task('upload', shell.task([                                                 
    'chmod 0600 id_rsa',                                                         
    'scp -iid_rsa -rpv www/* user@host:/path/'           
]));
```

The error:

```
[13:25:56] Starting 'upload'...
gulp: ../deps/uv/src/unix/core.c:422: uv__close: Assertion `fd > 2' failed.
[13:25:56] 'upload' errored after 228 ms

1399,Transparant caching in Shippable,schmmd, , ,OPEN,It's great to have caching in Shippable because it speeds our builds by more than 50%.  Shippable must have a slow connection to Maven Central because downloading dependencies is **slow**.  And downloading all dependencies for each build is insane for a complex JVM application.

However, Shippable's caching mechanism is far from perfect.  It's clear you have sacrifice development costs for product quality.  At our company, our caches frequently need to be invalidated because dependencies change and builds start to slow down again because of the new dependencies.  However, it's hard to stay on top of that, and it's yet another thing I need to educate the development team on.  Plus, when we reset our cache, the next ~5 builds are excruciatingly slow.

Transparent caching would be a huge boon to our company and a differentiating feature for Shippable.

On a much smaller scale, it would be great to have a button to invalidate the cache.  Presently, we notice the cache needs to be invalidated on Shippable, and then we switch over to Git, push a commit to a bogus branch with "[reset_minion]" in the title, and then delete the branch.  A button would be much more straightforward ;-),
1393,accessibility problems prevent me from getting to settings tab,zersiax, , ,OPEN,I am a screenreader user and currently unable to reach the settings -> Deployment keys portion of the settings area. The only settings I appear to be able to access are the general account settings. I need the deployment key for Heroku access, I cannot do work without it. Can this please be fixed, soon? Or at least give me a URL I can go to to reach this page directly? Thanks,
1380,encrypted env vars doesn't work with forked repos,hackerhasid, , ,OPEN,our development flow works like this:

1 - developers fork our repo
2 - developers work on their fork
3 - developers create pull requests when they're ready to merge back into the main repo

right now every user needs to encrypt variables themselves and this means that everyone needs their own `shippable.yml` file with these (differently) encrypted values! and none of the PRs can build because you guys won't decrypt env variables from forked repos for security reasons!

the solution codeship, heroku, and aws opsworks use for secure variables is storing them on the website (instead of in the shippable.yml). so as the admin for my company i'd set these variables inside shippable.com's ui.,
1371,Shorter custom timeout,winglian, , ,OPEN,There have been a lot of random timeouts lately. All successful builds take less than 15minutes, and if it runs longer than that, it times out. Is there a setting we can use in shippable.yml that we can use to simply set the timeout to 30 minutes instead of 2 hours so we aren't waiting for these random timeouts?
,
1370,MongoDB fails to start,nathanpeck, , ,OPEN,Trying to start MongoDB with the following shippable.yml:

1364,Explanation of build times?,nathanpeck, , ,OPEN,Shippable always shows times that look phenomenal when you view the build detail page:

![img](http://i.imgur.com/SjBWFWI.png)

It looks like that build took just 12 seconds.... But that is completely untrue, as the overall time was over 3 minutes according to the build list for the project. Additionally if I had started a stop watch the moment the buildimage step began and stopped it the moment it finished it would have been about 1 minute in length. The same goes for the other steps.

Can you explain how the timing works, and why the build details thinks it only took 12 seconds, while the build list clearly shows times of several minutes in length?,
1362,Git tag fails to start build,jchamberlain, , ,OPEN,On Travis, I could push a tag up and a build would start, just like with any other commit. On Shippable, the build tries to start but complains that there's no shippable.yml. Builds work fine for everything else, just not pushed tags. I'm only deploying when a tag is pushed, so right now I have to manually start a build whenever I push a tag.

In some ways, this is the opposite request of #905. I'd like to have the same behavior as Travis.,
1354,Build stalls after phpunit, and then stops with timeout,antonienko, , ,OPEN,I'm trying out shippable, and I want to see how everything works before upgrading the account to a paying one, but I'm getting stuck with one problem:

the build seem to freeze after the phpunit is completed, and finally after so many minutes it gives a timeout.

You can see the build here:
https://app.shippable.com/builds/553a228bbf6d0a0c00523d18

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance.,

1348,Issue with the "cache: true" option,hildingur, , ,OPEN,I have two private repo's in java where one depends on the other.

The upstream repo, builds find, but the build artifacts aren't cached for the downstream repo.

Thanks.,
1341,Artifacts download URL with Free plan for a private repo,cchantep, , ,OPEN,Hi,

Is it possible to get (if yes how) the download URL for the artifacts (the archive) created by a build, using a free Shippable plan with a private Bitbucket repository?

Best regards,
1338,can't reset settings override of shippable.yml,DanLipsitt, , ,OPEN,The settings in the web interface say they override the contents of shippable.yml. The problem is that there is no way to unset that override. This is compounded by the fact that you can't change some settings without changing others. This means you can't set enable-privileged-mode without also setting build-image, which I want to leave at the default value in shippable.yml.,
1336,Latest Python 2.7.x support,joaonvfigueiredo, , ,OPEN,Hi,

[This warning](https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning) yields due to using an older version of Python 2.7 SSL implementation. I'm using Python 2.7.8 which works without this warning.

The module that issues the warning (urllib3) is quite used for python web programming, and used by other modules such as requests. I'd say some more people are getting the warning.

Currently I see that the min/v2 container uses the Python 2.7.3 version, however the shippable.yml only seems to be able to select the major versions.

Is this possible:
@shippable.yml

    python:
      - 2.7.8
?

If not, am I forced to use a different build image that uses an updated version of Python?,
1325,No sufficient output ,fisera123, , ,OPEN,Hello,

1321,Update PHP composer version,claar, , ,OPEN,The composer version in shippable is from November 2014 (1.0.0-alpha10, hash ffffab3).

This old version doesn't understand current composer syntaxes, such as ^5.2, so I've had to add `composer self-update` to my build script, adding an unnecessary delay in build times and processing work/bandwidth for the build host.,
1315,In triggerBuild request: Passing a parameter from one build to another,vkuusk, , ,OPEN,We are doing chaining of several builds and need to pass "a string value" from one build to the next.
Currently we are using external location (private S3 bucket) to store this value (one build puts there, the next one reads from there).

the data we are transferring is just a small string.

Is it currently possible to pass a key:value pair to the triggerBuild request, so it becomes an environmental variable in the "next" build.

If it's not currently possible, will you consider adding this feature at some point in future?

Thanks,
1313,Failing on Install part of build,sojharo, , ,OPEN,Shippable sometimes fails to pull the libraries during the build process. After this, I go to the shippable website and run the build manually from there and then it gives no error.

1293,How to add ssh keys,z2z, , ,OPEN,How to add private ssh keys...  objective is to set up private bitbucket repos inside composer?,
1290,coverage: highlighted source code,jamestalmage, , ,OPEN,In Jenkins, the cobertura coverage output includes highlighted version of the source-code that allows you to easily see which lines are not covered. Using basically the same build process in Shippable (i.e. same result.xml file) - I am seeing basic coverage information information for each file, but no highlighted sources.

Is this a feature that Shippable does not support, or am I doing something wrong?,
1283,Include branch name in subject line of notification email,fzumstein, , ,OPEN,It would be great if that could be configured.,
1277,does shippable run builds for each git tag push on bit-bucket?,geshan, , ,OPEN,I think it does not run the build/tests for git tags pushed on bit-bucket can this be checked. In my opinion it should run the build on each git tag push only only branch push. thanks.,
1268,Primary/largest link in emails should be to the build results,catskul, , ,OPEN,I've been using Shippable for several months now and have found the email notifications a bit frustrating in their UX.

Virtually any time I want to go somewhere from the email it's going to be the details of a test failure.

However the test failure "details" link is the smallest most non-obvious link on the page, and when I'm in automatic mode, I always end up clicking one of the other links on the page, and end up annoyed.

IMO, the first and most obvious link on the page should be to the test results:
 * Not to shippable.com, no one who already uses the service would want to go there from this email
 * Not to the repo url, not sure what I would do from there
 * The commit hash is potentially useful but certainly not in comparison to why the build failed.

If you agree, please re-think the UX of your email alerts.

The easiest fix IMO would be link to move the results to the top, and the context information to the bottom, and to link the green/red "succeeded"/"failed" marker to the details. And un-link the Shippable icon. 
 ,
1267,Breadcrumbs linking is inconsistent,catskul, , ,OPEN,The bread crumb links in the top left do not follow a simple consistent scheme.

While looking at a project the text is:

    Team / project

If I click on project, I get taken to bitbucket.
If I click on team, I get taken to shippable team page

Once on the shippable team page the text is:
 
     Team

If I click on the team, I end up on the bitbucket page.

I regularly click on links on Shippable, and in Shippable emails and end up on bitbucket without meaning to. It's extremely frustrating, and despite having used Shippable for months now I still find myself ending up on pages I don't mean to be.

IMO virtually all links should link back to places within the shippable app, unless there's a compelling reason not to (links on commit hashes). I see no utility in arbitrarily linking back to revision control site. 

I'll open a separate ticket for the email UX.

1248,Shippable for java dependent projects,reddy6ue, , ,OPEN,I am trying to solve the following problem. 

I have three projects, a persistence layer library, a service layer library and a web application.

Shippable currently doesn't have a feature to kickoff cascading builds like Jenkins does. So, I decided to use git submodules to setup appropriate dependencies. Does anybody have a sample that makes git submodules work with a bitbucket git repo? 

Or alternately, has anybody solved the cascading dependent jobs problem like the one Jenkins provides?,

1239,Instructions to optimise a docker image for use in shippable,fommil, , ,OPEN,In our docker images, we try to guess what the Shippable minion environment wants to install to speed up the build: https://github.com/ensime/ensime-docker/blob/shippable-1.0/Dockerfile#L89

```
RUN\
  apt-get install -y locales git-core python-pip ssh &&\
  apt-get clean &&\
  pip install virtualenv &&\
  pip install --install-option="--prefix=/root/ve" pika boto glob2 &&\
  echo "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.gen &&\
  locale-gen
```

but there is still a significant amount of installation happening when the minion starts up that I can't pre-compute.

What else can we be doing to help startup speed? (and, especially with github being under attack, reduce network failure rate), e.g. today all our builds are failing because of 

```

1235,enable selected branches,fommil, , ,OPEN,I have some branches on my repos that I don't want shippable to build or complain about if there is missing `shippable.yml`.,
1233,don't require sudo,fommil, , ,OPEN,Longer term, you should be looking at dedicated host installations that **do not** require `sudo` permissions.

Given that you only:

* install python packages into your home directory
* launch docker

there is no reason for you to `sudo`, if I have given you access to run docker. I realise this means that you would not be able to run docker in privileged mode, but I'm very happy with that.
,
1214,intermittent build failures due to submodule,smaiyaki, , ,OPEN,my configuration is as thus:

* In the repository, I have added a submodule. I have however not staged the submodule to avoid my repo from being unnecessary big
* In shippable, in the before_script tag, I added these 2 steps:
  * git submodule init
  * git sumodule update
* At this stage, the submodule should be checkout during the build
* I will then cd in to the submodule and run a script that starts another build in the background

While this step works in most of the cases, it occasionally fails to run my script with the error that the script file could not be found. I have added some extra line to list out all the file listing before running the script file and it shows that the submodule has not been cloned and thus the failure. a rebuild or a couple of rebuilds will fix the issue

In summary, the submodule feature is a buggy I guess,
1208,Rebuild all open pull requests on push to destination branch,sigvef, , ,OPEN,Hi,

Thanks!,
1200,limit concurrent jobs on a dedicated node,fommil, , ,OPEN,The number of jobs running on a dedicated host appears to be unbounded, this can take the box down. It would be good to limit this on a per-host basis.,
1199,cancelling a job does not stop it on the node,fommil, , ,OPEN,On my dedicated nodes, if I start up a bunch of jobs and then cancel them, I can still see them running to completion on the nodes, eating up CPU cycles and precious resources.,
1198,support coveralls.io in pull requests,fommil, , ,OPEN,to get coveralls.io support in pull requests, I need to put my `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` in the `shippable.yml` file. I think it is correct that the encrypted vars should not be visible in pull requests, but it would also be good if some transient thing were made available to work with coveralls.io. Travis is able to do this by using their `TRAVIS_JOB_ID` but I think they have buy-in from `coveralls.io` to do this.,
1197,TypeError: on_connection_closed() takes exactly 2 arguments (4 given),fommil, , ,OPEN,While debugging another issue, I found a lot of these errors in the shippable logs:

1196,connection error on dedicated node,fommil, , ,OPEN,I have two dedicated nodes: both successfully deployed, but one is working and the other is not. Both are hosted by the same provider, but are running different flavours of Linux: the succeeding one is running Ubuntu, the failing one is running Debian.

This is an example of a failure https://app.shippable.com/builds/550d5d8f21d6a90b00366cf4 which is using the normal shippable docker image. It also fails for custom images.

```

```

If I manually log in to the box as the `shippable` user, I am able to issue this command

```
docker pull shippable/minv2 
```

which works (although, notably, it had to download everything first).

It would help me greatly if you could let me see the script that is running and failing... there is probably some missing unix utility or a python/shell version mismatch.,

1179,Setting user for custom image,thephred, , ,OPEN,I am trying to run a custom docker build image via a dedicated host.  It has a user setup in it for the build and I would like shippable to launch the build with that user similar to how minv2 runs as shippable.  However, it only runs as root.  There was a reference in another ticker to the fact that you could set the user in the shippable.yml but I couldn't find how to do this in the docs and guessing how to do it has failed.  Any clue on this?,
1173,RFE: exit build with message to appear on github, etc,fommil, , ,OPEN,It would be really great if scripts could be written with some extra information that would appear in PRs if they fail, e.g. instead of the current

```bash
  - sbt ++$SCALA_VERSION clean test:compile it:compile doc &&
    sbt ++$SCALA_VERSION test it:test &&
    sbt ++$SCALA_VERSION publishLocal &&
    ensime-emacs/test/run_emacs_tests.sh &&
```

imagine if we could write

```bash
  - sbt ++$SCALA_VERSION clean test:compile it:compile doc || failed "compilation"
  - sbt ++$SCALA_VERSION test it:test || failed "tests"
  - sbt ++$SCALA_VERSION publishLocal &&
    ensime-emacs/test/run_emacs_tests.sh || failed "integration tests"
```

it would be even better if the PR comment included a link to the relevant part of the log.

Under Travis rules, if a line fails the others will still be evaluated. I'd like a way of just exiting immediately with the message. Anything that speeds up the cycle is good.,
1172,failure in after_success should not influence the results,fommil, , ,OPEN,related somewhat to #1165 I just had a build fail because of a failure in `after_success` https://app.shippable.com/builds/5504edc19b228b0d005bdfbe

This shouldn't happen: the build has succeeded at this point and failures in `after_success` should be ignored (perhaps a notification?),
1169,jdk flag is ignored,fommil, , ,OPEN,I changed our builds to use the Ubuntu 14.04 (instead of 12.02) docker images, but now it's clear that the config entry

```
jdk:
  - openjdk6
```

is being ignored because our tests always fail on these two unit tests if the java sources are not installed, and I only installed `openjdk-6-source` https://app.shippable.com/builds/5504c2e29b228b0d005bde28

I can only presume that `JAVA_HOME`, `JDK_HOME` and all the various `java` binaries are not pointing at my selected java.

Workaround is to manually type something like this in `install`, which is what the `jdk` entry should be doing behind the scenes.

```
sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-1.6.0-openjdk-amd64 &&
export JAVA_HOME=$(readlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed "s:bin/java::") &&
export JDK_HOME=$(readlink -f /usr/bin/javac | sed "s:bin/javac::")

However, there is no option to do this... so I've had to delete it and when I want to try and get it working again I'll have to add all the details, delete the other nodes (because I'd like to isolate this node) and then add everything again.,
1165,result is not published to github when `script` stage finishes,fommil, , ,OPEN,I have some big `after_success` jobs that are slow and trigger downstream behaviours (e.g. coverage reports from coveralls.io) but Shippable seems to be waiting for **everything** to finish before reporting success, especially back to github (e.g. updating a PR status or badge).

The correct behaviour should be that when the `script` stage finishes, the triggers to update github and badges should be fired.,
1160,RFE: travis-style tail log,fommil, , ,OPEN,Can you please implement the ability to follow the tail of the log, the way travis does?,
1159,ignoring travis apt_packages,fommil, , ,OPEN,With your docker support, I'm certain you have a much better way of doing this, but for the awesome "10 seconds to migrate from travis" claim, you might want to fix this.

When trying to push or deploy to CloudControl I get a timeout.

In my case, when trying to execute `cctrlapp shippablecloudcontrolexample/default deploy` I get a timeout.
I think it's weird that it completely freezes.
Is it possible that the cctrlapp command is prompting for input and that that line doesn't get logged in the shippable output? ,

Otherwise they take quite a bit longer, and I see little benefit over using Travis. It would be much simpler to ship the requirements preinstalled (there's only like 3 of them) in the directory you mount into the container. The dependencies are pinned anyway, so when you want to change them, you can reship them. 

Also, you seem to overwrite the files in /home/shippable/wrk occasionally, so I can't just edit the file and have my tests always work :),

I am using shippable in India for last 2-3 weeks. I find shippable app to load really slow (15+ secs) on my 16Mbps connection. I guess thats because shippable prod app is not combining js/css, 

- total of 115 unminified scripts, amount to 2.2 MB which can reduce by 75% and we could definitely use CDN for angular, socket and other third party libs
- total of 12 css which could be combine
- We could definitely use CDN to host js/css/images

I am sure shippable team would be knowing about these issues but if they could prioritise in their grand scheme of things (no pun intended, u guys are doing awesome stuff!) it would make my life easier

I am more than willing to help if required,

953,Multiple dedicated hosts with common IP: Punching through firewall/NAT,taqtiqa-mark, , ,OPEN,Hi, I'd like to know if you have tested, or are aware of users successfully using ngrok to connect to multiple dedicated hosts sharing an IP address of the host.

Related issues are;
#839 @ragsden Establishes that Shippable : 
- needs general outbound access
- needs SSH access to `<subdomain>.ngrok.com:<number>`

#837 Establishes that Shippable can (since 6-Dec-2014) utilize multiple dedicated hosts with same IP and different ports.

The question arises when combining #839 and #837.  That is, multiple dedicated hosts on the same IP adderess behind firewall/NAT:
- Does Shippable require SSH access via a port that is dedicated to each dedicated host...?

That is, in the example in #837, I would set up ngrok to tunnel TCP traffic as follows:
````
mysubdom.ngrok.com:10122 -> 1.1.1.1 port 10122
mysubdom.ngrok.com:10222 -> 1.1.1.1 port 10222

794,Re-run individual builds environments ,hanloong, , ,OPEN,Is it possible to run individual builds (So just build 19.2 not 19.X which would include (19.1, 19.2, 19.3 etc)).

We have setup environments to run builds separately.
 - unit tests
 - integration tests
 - external integration tests (rely on external API's)

Unit tests are super reliable, integration tests less so, and external integration even less than that. On Travis if one of these fails we can just trigger a re-run of that test and leave the others as passed.

I know most people tend to mock out external API calls during tests but we have been burnt by our payment gateway API making breaking changes to existing API versions, so this is the best way to make sure our code is stable.,
790,Piped command breaks execution -- or just the log,bittner, , ,OPEN,I'm using a series of piped commands to validate an HTML file as part of the build process. The [YAML file](https://bitbucket.org/bittner/adventsbasar/src/master/shippable.yml#cl-12) validates (with [Travis WebLint](http://lint.travis-ci.org/)) and the build process seems to execute successfully. However, the [build log](https://app.shippable.com/builds/546c825a7aac73c600837567) looks a bit odd:
```
(-)  script                                                                ? 1 seconds
      bash -c '! python html5check.py home/*.html
    (+) csslint --format=compact home/*.css
    Build script completed 
```
## Command is cut off at first pipe

The first script command really is:
```
bash -c '! python html5check.py home/*.html | grep -v "Error:.*frameborder.*attribute.*iframe" | grep "Error:\ "'
```
In the console log only the part before the first pipe shows up. There is no output of the command shown, but that *may* be correct, because with no errors there is no output. Also when I download the console log the text output is not much better: The part starting at the first pipe character is missing completely.

Is this just a text output error or is part of the command *actually* swallowed?

## Side Note

I need to do the weird `bash -c '...'` construct, because the YAML won't validate with a simple negated Bash command line. Explained with examples in https://github.com/mozilla/html5-lint/issues/9.,
774,Rspec & Cucumber output with colors,ArturT, , ,OPEN,It would be great to have colorized output for script command. It's much easier to read rspec or cucumber output when I see what's green or red. Feature badly needed. :),
771,SHIPPABLE_MINION_INDEX and SHIPPABLE_MINION_TOTAL,ArturT, , ,OPEN,Could you provide variables:
* `SHIPPABLE_MINION_INDEX` it should starts from zero.
* `SHIPPABLE_MINION_TOTAL` it says how many minions particular build has.

I created knapsack gem https://github.com/ArturT/knapsack and I'd like to integrate it with shippable. It would be nice to have mentioned envs. CircleCI has similar thing https://circleci.com/docs/parallel-manual-setup#env-splitting,

693,regex & wildcards in branch exclusion,jeradphelps, , ,OPEN,I'd like to be able to run builds on wildcards for git-flow branches.  For instance, something like this:

~~~
branches:
  only:
    - master
    - develop
    - feature/*
    - release/*
    - support/*
    - hotfix/*
~~~

Is this supported?  It is not documented (though it is for [travis](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/#Using-regular-expressions)), and in my initial tests, it is not working. ,
679,Don't see build status for each commit on Github,rockerhieu, , ,OPEN,Recently I don't see any icon to indicate build status for each commit on Github from Shippable. My project is https://app.shippable.com/projects/543f4a86b904a4b215678013. I tried to delete and re-enable the project on Shippable, but it didn't fix the issue.,
656,Make the project, build URL human understandable,rockerhieu, , ,OPEN,Let me take Circle CI as an example:
* https://circleci.com/gh/:account/:project/tree/:branch
* https://circleci.com/gh/:account/:project/:build_number
,
616,Support code analysis,rockerhieu, , ,OPEN,The idea is to parse any Lint/FindBugs/PMD code analysis results in `shippable/codeanalysis` and render them like you're doing with `shippable/testcoverage` and `shippable/testresults`.,
604,Support for http://ccmenu.org/ status monitoring,toby-griffiths, , ,OPEN,Hi there,

Just started playing with CI & found it nice & easy to setup the initial repos.  Now to configure the build.

Do you now, or plan to in the future, support feeds for monitoring build status using tools such as [CCMenu](http://ccmenu.org/)?,
601,Shippable account does not use Github primary email,arielschiavoni, , ,OPEN,Hi,

I have a Github account with two different emails configured.
Then when I created a Shippable account linked to Github it seems to be using the last email in that list which is not the primary one.

Thanks.

593,.travis.yml does not respect defined python version,raymondwanyoike, , ,OPEN,Setting a specific python version (`2.7.8` instead of `2.7`) in `.travis.yml` has no effect.

```
language: python
python:
    - "2.7.8"
...
```

All builds are being made against python `2.7.3` (build log)

```
Installing setuptools, pip...done.

578,Login page clobbers original destination,luhn, , ,OPEN,Observed behavior:

* Click on a link to a Shippable build, such as `https://app.shippable.com/#/builds/123456`, with no logged in session or an expired login session
* You are redirected to `http://www.shippable.com/#/builds/123456`.
* Click on "Login" in top right.
* Click "GitHub auth"  (I assume BitBucket auth behaves similarly, but I haven't verified.)
* You are logged in and redirected to `https://app.shippable.com/`.

Desired behavior:  After login, be redirected to the initial destination:, `https://app.shippable.com/#/builds/123456`.

Another suggestion:  It would make it flow a little smoother if we were redirected to a dedicated login page (containing "GitHub auth" and "BitBucket auth" in very large buttons, and little else), rather than the homepage.  It might not be evident from the homepage that a login is being requested, nor is it immediately clear where one is able to log in.,
570,Manually triggered deployments,pniederw, , ,OPEN,Couldn't find a discussion forum so posting here. I'm building an OSS library that needs to get published to Maven OSS/Maven Central. Each build should get published to Maven OSS, but only manually selected builds (releases) should get published to Maven Central.  Does Shippable support manually triggered deployments (i.e. pull model)?,
457,[Consolidated feature request] Support additional platforms,micw, , ,OPEN,Hi,

in the documentaion I found:
(Coming soon) Our Windows minions are based on AWS AMI for Windows 2012.

Do you have any time plan when this feature will be available?

Kind regards,
Michael Wyraz.

431,Make project/build status links shorter and human readable,yihui, , ,OPEN,e.g. compare the badge URL's:

- Shippable: https://api.shippable.com/projects/53fa5b48c9a91cb5066f8468/badge/master
- Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/yihui/formatR.svg

I strongly prefer Travis CI URL's (username/repo instead of a long hash string).,
407,Upgrade Cassandra Service to Datastax Community Edition,tristanwietsma, , ,OPEN,Moving from Shippable/sample_ruby_cassandra#3

The current Cassandra service minion is running 1.1.12, which is over a year behind the current stable release (2.0.9).

Travis-CI's Cassandra service is based on the Datastax Community Edition:
http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/#Cassandra
http://planetcassandra.org/cassandra/

Please consider upgrading Cassandra to the latest stable release in the very near future. I'm running into API changes between the preferred client and your minion, rendering the service unusable.,
400,Tailing the logs,hhimanshu, , ,OPEN,Just like Travis-CI provides the way to tail the logs, it would be nice to have that feature in Shippable as well.  

manual scrolling is bad :(

256,Update Git to support subtree command,tinchou, , ,OPEN,I have a project with a structure like this:

````
-
| - dev
| - docs
| - spikes
````

In order to deploy the `dev` folder to Heroku, I was using `git subtree` from my own computer as shown here: https://coderwall.com/p/ssxp5q. Now I'm trying to delegate the deployment step to Shippable.

When the minion finishes building and executes `git subtree push --prefix 'dev' heroku master` (set in the `after_success` section of my `shippable.yml` file), I get the following message:

````
git: subtree is not a git command. See git --help.
````

It seems that you have an outdated version without subtree support. Hope you can update Git to allow us to use this feature.

Also, there is no documentation on how to use a build environment different than Ubuntu 12.04. Should it be as follows? (I tried it, nothing changed)

````
build_environment: ubuntu1310
````

In case you want to check, the ID of my project is `53acd8e1c40d71a900e7e704`.

Thanks,

237,BitBucket Pull Request Support,coreybutler, , ,OPEN,Any timeline on pull request support with BitBucket? Every CI service has Github integration... this would be a nice differentiating factor.,
190,[Consolidated Feature request] Integration with additional tools/services,pmatsinopoulos, , ,OPEN,Does Shippable support Solr integration?,
182,HTTP api for getting build status.,RX14, , ,OPEN,This would be useful for external applications such as an IDE where they can show whether the build is failing or not. Requires #53 ,
174,Code coverage enhancements,epicserve, , ,OPEN,It would be nice if on the coverage tab it showed the source code with hits or misses, when you click on the plus for each file.

Here is a screenshot of the area I'm referring to.

![shippable 2014-05-30 16-10-18 2014-05-30 16-11-38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/191620/3136210/01c28838-e83f-11e3-8497-73828d453a66.jpg)
,
146,Add better build artifacts handling.,RX14, , ,OPEN,I would prefer the build artifacts to be handled like Jenkins. You should be able to upload multiple files by where they are instead or simply zipping the shippable folder. There should be an artifacts tab with all the different artifacts you specify and also a download of all of the artifacts (incl. code coverage and test results)
For example:
````yml
#shippable.yml

artifacts:
  - build/libs/Test-*.jar #Import a file
  - build/libs #Zip the libs folder and send it as an artifact
````

This would be a great addition to a service that I have otherwise found faultless (so far...),
105,[Consolidated Feature request] Support additional languages,manuel-rubio, , ,OPEN,Hi,

I'll try to build my ephp project in shippable and I can see an advice to open an issue to support that so, here is my issue! please, give support to erlang language!

30,Schedule Runs,plotti, , ,OPEN,Is there a way to make shippable run an integration test once a week? Sometimes I'dont have code that i push during that week but the underlying apis might have changed, and I'd like to make sure that the software is still working. Any ideas?

Cheers
